# a simple webserver to search rsid in large dbsnp database
Most of the code about web module is generated by AI. Search process use the tabix.
```
git clone https://github.com/TuBieJun/search_rsid.git
cd search_rsid
export SEARCH_RS_DB_FILE="THE_PATH_OF_DB_TABIX_INDEX_FILE"
flask run
```

The db file should be compressed by bgzip and built index by tabix. The db file context show:
```
rs      3       13      32446842        C       T
rs      4       13      32447222        A       G
rs      5       7       91839110        C       T
rs      6       7       91747131        A       G
rs      7       7       91779557        T       A
rs      8       7       92408329        C       T
rs      9       7       92373453        TG      T
rs      10      7       92383888        A       C,G,T
```
The trick to search rsid in large dbsnp vcf by tabix come from this [issue](https://github.com/samtools/htslib/issues/427#issuecomment-253655392).  
The web interface is shown in the figure below.
